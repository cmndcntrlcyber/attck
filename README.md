# One ATT&CK at a Time Stage
This is the companion project for staging payloads from [One ATT&CK at a Time](https://github.com/cmndcntrlcyber/one-attck-per-time/tree/main) and executing them to simulate or emulate MITRE's ATT&CKs. 

An example can be found here at [https://attck.community](https://attck.community).
